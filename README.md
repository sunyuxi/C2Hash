MSRSI is a Multi-Source Remote Sensing Image dataset. This dataset includes fifteen distinct land-cover categories and encompasses five different types of RS image sources. The land-cover categories include industrial area, dense residential, sea & lake, river, bridge, rectangular farmland, circular farmland, forest, grassland, beach, wastewater plant, solar panel, desert, airport, and overpass. The sources are VHR, SAR, MSI, MAP, and PAN images. The dataset consists of 150,000 images collected from these image sources. Each image source contains 30,000 images, while each land-cover category comprises 2,000 images.
